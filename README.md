# The-Bin

A simple project using a Raspberry Pico to display MPU6050 accelerometer data on an OLED display. If there is no acceleration, a buzzer plays, and a servo changes position depending on whether acceleration is positive or negative in the x-direction. A button controls the whole program to make adjusting the accelerometer easier.
